git clone https://github.com/hassanamir/hassan_portfolio.git
cd hassan_portfolio
```

```

3. Run the app:

## Troubleshooting

### Startup Error Fix
If you encounter startup errors that disappear after reload, this is likely due to Google Fonts initialization. The app includes error handling for this:

1. **Google Fonts**: The app uses safe Google Fonts loading with fallback to system fonts
2. **Flutter Animate**: Proper initialization handling for animations
3. **Asset Loading**: Safe asset loading with error handling

### Common Issues

1. **Font Loading Error**: The app will fallback to system fonts if Google Fonts fails to load
2. **Animation Error**: Animations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
3. **Asset Error**: Missing assets will show placeholder content
